##DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM.

The dataset have been gotten of: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sarahvch/breast-cancer-wisconsin-prognostic-data-set/data

The title of this dataset is: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Prognostic) Data Set

Each row is a case of breast cancer of Dr. Wolberg. 
There are 32 columns in total with different features related to tumors in breast.

The second column is 'diagnosis': M='maligne', 'B=benigne'. This column will be our goal in the prediction.

Summary, the goal of this project is create a model to predict the diagnosis of any patient using the most important features to describe the tumor. 

##INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE PROJECT.

1) Download the dataset in https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sarahvch/breast-cancer-wisconsin-prognostic-data-set/data o download this repository.
2) Open notebook.ipynb and running line by line (following the comments of this file). In the last part is showed the accuracy of different models to select the best. In the case of this dataset, the best model is RandomForestClassification. 
3) Run train.py to train the selected model in the step 2.
4) Run predict.py to test the generated model about a new dataset.
